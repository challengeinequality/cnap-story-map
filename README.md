# Making Nuisance Neighborhoods
Exposing the Effects of Community Policing in Los Angeles <br>
This project is in collaboration with the UCLA Luskin Institute on Inequality and Democracy. 

The story map was created using MapBox. Changes to the story map content can be made in the config.js file. Images can be updated in the image folder. The index.html shouldn't need to be edited.
